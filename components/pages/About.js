        <h1>Our Journey</h1>
       <p>Let's Fund Your Dreams (LFYD) was founded as a business development organisation to assist merchants in obtaining capital and other necessities for the efficient and effective operation of their business. The reason our business was given this name is that we began the process of assisting people in realising their aspirations in the most effective manner.

          It was a prolonged journey. Seen many ups and downs, hit hard, and required a lot of work, tried to obtain funding, waited a long time for it, and then started experimenting with new concepts like commissions, events, and other things. After then, we encountered a new issue because Covid 19 began to affect our nation at the same time when we were building our offline brand, nearly putting a halt to everything. Then we decided to release our tech product, called Fydo.

          And now, with a strong merchant service and customer base.We are live in 5+ cities, 1,000,000+ satisfied customers, 10,000+ Merchants are on board, and trusted by 50+ PAN India brands.</p>
